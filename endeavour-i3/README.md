# TODO
- picom:
  - fix nm-applet menu corner shadows
- dunstify segfaults when -r/--replace is used so brightness notifications stopped working
  - turns out it was libnotify update which caused the segfault.. downgraded it
- Copy all GTK files so the settings actually get synced like the font and theme preference
- remove sudo from syncfiles in extract mode
- set default application for opening directories
